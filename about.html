      <h2>About Roast House Cafe</h2>
      <div class="container about-box">
        <p>
          Roast House Cafe was founded with a simple mission — to bring premium,
          freshly roasted coffee to local communities. We carefully source
          high-quality beans from trusted farms around the world and roast them
          in small batches to ensure maximum freshness and flavor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our expert roasters use modern roasting techniques combined with
          traditional craftsmanship to bring out unique tasting notes in every
          bean. From fruity light roasts to bold dark roasts, every cup tells a
          story.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe coffee is more than just a drink — it is an experience. Our
          cafes are designed as warm, welcoming spaces where people can relax,
          work, and connect over great coffee.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Roast House Cafe, quality, sustainability, and customer
          satisfaction are at the heart of everything we do.
